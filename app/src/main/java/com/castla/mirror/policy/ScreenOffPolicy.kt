/**
 * Pure-logic state machine for screen-off mirroring.
 *
 * Strategy priority:
 * 1. Physical panel OFF (scrcpy approach) — Samsung preferred path.
 *    Device stays awake, VD keeps rendering, physical screen goes dark.
 * 2. Keep-alive (periodic wakeUpDisplay) — fallback when panel-off fails.
 * 3. Normal lock — not actively supported (may cause black screen on VD).
 *
 * Thread safety: call from a single thread (main/service scope).
